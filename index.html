    <p>I am a second-year computer science PhD student at Duke University advised by Cynthia Rudin and Alex Volfovsky. I am broadly interested in developing interpretable causal inference methods for complex data. My co-first-author work on stable variable importance via Rashomon sets was accepted to NeurIPS 2023 as a spotlight! Check out the work here <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TczT2jiPT5">here.</a>

    <p>In the past, I was a research assistant at Temple University's Data Science Institute working with <a href="https://airoldi.github.io/">Dr. Edoardo Airoldi</a>, <a href="http://www.mcalinn.com/">Dr. Ken McAlinn</a>, and Dr. Jeanne Ruane and the <a href="https://dabi.temple.edu/">Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics</a> working with <a href = "https://dabi.temple.edu/zoran-obradovic/">Dr. Zoran Obradovic</a>. During my time at Temple University, I explored applied problems spanning the psychology behind economic decision making, tipping behavior in digital platforms and the gig economy, and charitable giving behavior. I also explored methodological network problems involving a novel mechanistic network model for producing non-scale-free degree distributions.</p>
